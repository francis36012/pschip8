Screen =
	default bg: black

	draw ins (DXYN) =
		X <= 3F && Y <= 1F
		Draw sprites (length N) starting at positino VX(reg),VY(reg) with
		sprite data located at address I(reg). A single byte corresponds to
		one row of the sprite, e.g. if N is 4, the sprite will be 4 units high

		The draw operation is performed in an exclusive-or (XOR) mode, i.e incoming
		sprite data is XOR'ed with existing data in the video memory. This mode
		can be used to clear a sprite by drawing the same sprite at the same
		location. If a pixel to be drawn happens to have the same state as a corresponding
		pixel on screen, VF is set to 00, else VF is set to 00

	cls ins (00E0) =
		Clears the screen
