# pschip8

This is a chip-8 interpreter written in the rust programming language. This
is also my first emulator (or interpreter) project.

## Building and Running
`cargo` is used to build the interpreter

To build
```
cargo build --release
```
After building, using the command above, you will find the binary in target/release
